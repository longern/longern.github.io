# Welcome
As my previous personal website will expire after my graduation, I have to move my blog to a permanent service provider. GitHub + Jekyll is a good choice for building a blog if dynamic pages are not necessary. All you have to do is clone a theme and then write Markdowns in GitHub editor. Code snippets will be automatically rendered. For example:
```python
temp = x
x = y
y = temp
```

Theme: https://github.com/codeasashu/hcz-jekyll-blog

Rendering formulas such as $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ is WIP.
